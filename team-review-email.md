**Subject:** Investor Site Live — Please Review for Accuracy

---

Hey team,

The investor site is live and I'd like everyone to take a pass before we share it externally. I've sent each of you individual login credentials — check your inbox.

**Site:** [redewable.com](https://www.redewable.com)

Please review the following pages for accuracy:

- **At a Glance** — investment thesis, economics, queue positioning, team bios
- **Development Funds** — updated to $320K lean / $583K full (removed FiberLight feasibility — already confirmed)
- **Technical** — SLD is now uploaded and marked complete, OEM specs, EPC scope
- **Interconnection** — new FiberLight fiber connectivity section, injection study details, supporting docs
- **Team** — bios for everyone, partner logos
- **Permitting** — CUP status, timeline

A few things I'm specifically looking for:

1. **Chuck** — confirm your bio is accurate, review the capital stack and development funds numbers
2. **James** — confirm your bio, review the economics section and revenue assumptions (still waiting on Bob's projections)
3. **Ethan** — review interconnection and technical pages for accuracy, especially the Enerzinx study details and ERCOT timeline

I have a call with Enerzinx this morning to nail down a few interconnection details and timelines, so the interconnection page may get a minor update after that.

Flag anything that looks off — typos, wrong numbers, missing context. This is going to Kola first so it needs to be tight.

Thanks,
Talor
