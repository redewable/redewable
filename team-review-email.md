**Subject:** Investor Site Live — Please Review for Accuracy

---

Hey team,

The investor site is live and I'd like everyone to take a pass before we share it externally. I've sent each of you individual login credentials — check your inbox.

**Site:** [redewable.com](https://www.redewable.com)

Please review the following pages for accuracy:

- **At a Glance** — investment thesis, economics, queue positioning, team bios
- **Development Funds** — updated to $320K lean / $583K full (removed FiberLight feasibility — already confirmed)
- **Technical** — SLD is now uploaded and marked complete, OEM specs, EPC scope
- **Interconnection** — new FiberLight fiber connectivity section, injection study details, supporting docs
- **Team** — bios for everyone, partner logos
- **Permitting** — CUP status, timeline

A few things I'm specifically looking for:

1. **Chuck** — confirm your bio is accurate, review the capital stack and development funds numbers
2. **James** — confirm your bio, review the economics section and revenue assumptions (still waiting on Bob's projections)
3. **Ethan** — review interconnection and technical pages for accuracy, especially the Enerzinx study details and ERCOT timeline

**One structural note** — the land is held separately through our strategic land partner and offered to the buyer as a long-term lease. It's not part of the project sale or the development capital raise. If a buyer strongly prefers to own the land, we're open to that conversation, but the default structure keeps it off the capital stack and simplifies the transaction. You'll see this reflected across the site — devfunds, at-a-glance, and the economics section all frame it as a lease with no upfront acquisition cost. I have a call with our land partner today to confirm this direction as well.

I also have a call with Enerzinx this morning to nail down a few interconnection details and timelines, so the interconnection page may get a minor update after that.

Flag anything that looks off — typos, wrong numbers, missing context. This is going to Kola first so it needs to be tight.

Thanks,
Talor
